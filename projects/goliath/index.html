                  <p>
                    Goliath is a fast-paced platformer where players use their hookshot to traverse the environment and ultimately scale the “Goliath”. This game was developed by a team of 13 students (8 from the UC Irvine; 5 from Laguna College of Arts and Design) as the senior capstone project for the Computer Game Science major at UC Irvine. Development took place over two quarters (Fall and Winter) for approximately 20 weeks. Employees from Blizzard Entertainment were also involved to assist and mentor us during the development of the game.  Our mentors were Anders Ekermo (Fall), Wyatt Cheng (Winter), and Lee Sparks (Winter). <a href="https://kromis.wordpress.com/2015/04/24/post-mortem-goliath/">Read Postmortem</a>

                  <h3 style="text-align:center">Role</h3>
                  <p>
                  My role for this project was designer during the first half of development and transitioned to animator during the second half. I worked with two other designers on game mechanics and levels in addition to working with the artists.</p>

                  <p class="subheader">Game Mechanics</p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>I developed a prototype of the Goliath battle in Unity to explore level design and as a target for gameplay</li>
                    <li>I helped refine gameplay elements (gravity, player speed, jump speed) after gathering feedback from the mentors and other playtesters</li>
                    <li>I collaborated with the other designers in the direction of the game as well as gameplay features using Reddit</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="subheader">Levels</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I mocked up and created early levels for testing purposes and to inform level design guidelines</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="subheader">Animations</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I created the majority of the animations for the player character - idle, run, death, grapple, and falling (not in the game)</li>
                  </ul>
