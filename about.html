                <p>Salutations and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Khai Nguyen and I'm a game developer. I'm currently a 4th year Computer Game Science major at UC Irvine and pursuing a career in game design. My passion for video game development stems from two things:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><em>a desire to create games that will have a <b>profound</b> impact on lives</em> and</li>
                  <li><em>to <b>transcend</b> video games as an art form</em></li>
                </ul>

                <p>One of my interests is in <b>Human-Computer Interaction</b>. I hope to learn from HCI methodologies in order to better inform the design of my video games. I'm very curious in what makes people "tick": to find out what drives them, what they hate, what they love. Mastery of such understanding is something that I strive for as a game developer and designer.</p>

                <p>I often find myself more of an Informatics person rather than one of Computer Science. For that, I've taken an interest in <b>web development</b> and this website is my first step into that world. Complementary to web development, I'm also interested in <b>UI/UX research</b>. Again, it is my desire to understand others better in order to build something compelling and appealing to individuals. Nothing would satisfy me more than others enjoying something I helped create.</p>

                <p>Besides web development technologies, I plan on learning more of Unreal Engine 4. I'm fairly comfortable with working in Unity but I'd like to experience a more complex engine (with C++). Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects are fairly essential to UI/UX and game development so those are also on my list of things to learn.</p>


                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam but raised in Rosemead and San Gabriel, CA for most of my life. When I was a child, I was happy to have three things: TV, LEGO, and video games. With TV, I loved escaping reality and immersing myself in the cartoon worlds of Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon (among others); <i>The Busy World of Richard Scarry</i> was a favorite of mine. With LEGO, I was constantly wondering about the next thing I wanted to build and the imginary world I wanted to play in; I especially loved building robots and futuristic weapons. With video games, it was both the immersion and challenge that they offered that I loved; Super Mario World and A Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past were quite a challenge to me, actually (I was never able to beat them then). But their worlds kept me engaged and playing (and trying). These forms of entertainment had a profound effect on me - I knew I wanted to create/build something when I grew up.</p>
                <p>In high school, I found myself interested in computer science. I tried a programming class (AP Computer Science A in Java) and passed the AP test. As happy as I was with passing, I felt programming was too difficult and switched to engineering instead. I went to Pasadena City College to study mechanical engineering (later switching to electrical) and transfer to a 4-year college. To finish my transfer requirements, I realized I had to finish a C++ class (that meant programming)! Coming from Java, C++ wasn't so bad although pointers were tricky. I managed to pass the class anyway and had a somewhat renewed interest and appreciation for programming.</p>
                <p>UC Irvine was one of the four schools I had applied to for electrical engineering. For my backup major, I felt strongly enough about going back to computer science that I chose "computer game science" as my major. Upon entering, I discovered the Video Game Development Club; I have been developing games ever since.</p>
